            <p>Woman is beauty! <br> “In a unique way, beauty belongs to women. In
                His affection for His daughters, God bestowed on women the gift of
                beauty and equipped us to perpetuate beauty.”3
                 It is precisely
                because we are made in the image and likeness of the Creator that
                we are capable of manifesting beauty. However, the woman shares
                in something quite unique that sets her apart from man and gives
                her a beauty unlike any other, the gift of bringing forth life.Women are the custodians of both beauty and life. The body
                of the woman was and still is an essential part of God’s salvific plan.
                Through Eve God generated “all the living”; through Mary’s yes, God
                brought about Salvation through Jesus Christ to a fallen world. The
                bodies of both man and woman are stamped with the image of God
                so that by and through their bodies they reveal God to one another.5
                But it is the body of the woman that brings forth life and
                perpetuates beauty. Life and beauty are so integrated in woman
                that they become one, especially in her.

                <p>She was born on May 31st, 1725 in Gram Chundi, Maratha Empire. She is regarded as one of the finest female rulers 
                    in Indian history. She spread the message of dharma and promoted industrialisation in the 18th century. After the 
                    death of her husband and father-in-law, she ruled Malwa in a wise and sagacious manner. On various occasions, she 
                    led the army herself from the front like a brave warrior, armed with bows and arrows on the elephant. It is said 
                    that during her reign, Malwa was never once attacked and remained an oasis of stability and peace. </p>

                <p>She was born on February 13th, 1879 in Hyderabad, State of British India. She was an Indian political activist and poet.
